(soft beeping)
- [Falcon] The best boss fights
make a good game even better.
Now, it's a new year,
so we're starting strong
with one of our obsessions
here at Gameranx.
You know, boss fights, man.
These are the biggest, craziest,
and most incredible bosses
in video game history.
We say if you don't fight
these bosses before you die,
you're missing out.
We got  of them, so let's
get started off with number .
A good example where the biggest bosses
aren't always like the hardest.
"God of War III" took boss fights
and really turned them into
these incredible spectacles.
And the first one, Kronos,
might literally be the biggest boss
on our list technically.
This guy is so huge that Kratos
is like a tiny little speck in comparison.
Now, this fight begins with you fighting
the dude's fingertip.
In the world of God of War,
these titans are the
precursors of the gods
and they're also just really, really huge.
They're the size of mountains.
And Kronos is the biggest.
He's actually got like
a mountain on his back.
And this battle still to this day
is like a technical marvel.
This game ran really well
on an old PlayStation 
and the remastered version
makes the battle look even better.
The God of War games have always
been a technical showcase.
Yeah, but like this just
really blew our tiny brains
back in the day.
And it still does.
- My eyes!
(dramatic music)
(Kronos yells)
Damn mortals.
You will suffer when my sight returns.
- [Falcon] The way the camera pulls away
to then show you the full
scale of the opponent
as the music swells is just brilliant.
And it just gets us even more hyped.
You know, we're not
fighting some chump here.
We're fighting the
biggest chump of the gods.
Kronos is a fight that's so insane,
nothing else compares in
the rest of the series
in terms of that sheer size.
You'll fight across his giant hand,
battling swarms of enemies
as you climb all over him.
There's something hilarious about Kratos
scrambling around the world's biggest dude
and attacking his
fingernails to deal damage.
It's ridiculous and
amazing at the same time.
And that honestly is peak God of War.
(dramatic music)
(Kronos yells)
Next over at number , "Cuphead."
It's a game that's like all
about the bosses, obviously.
There are like a handful
of the regular levels,
but the majority of the time
you're spent just doing boss fights
and dying over and over again.
A lot of the bosses in
Cuphead could qualify
for a best bosses ever list, honestly,
but we're gonna try and
stick with just one,
a more recent one, the final
boss of the "Cuphead" DLC,
Chef Saltbaker, which doesn't
sound that impressive.
He's a chef with one of
those like silly chef hats.
How impressive could he be?
If you're one of the few
that actually managed to fight this chef,
you're in for a treat, man.
He's like a beast of a boss
with three increasingly
wild and thrilling phases.
Like what starts out as a
pretty standard boss fight
in Chef Saltbaker's bakery
then becomes something else entirely.
You know, probably like
the art in "Cuphead"
is always really insane.
The smooth, bouncy s
era animation style
is what really made
people notice this game.
But Saltbaker as the grand
finale really goes all out.
The single boss took months
apparently to animate
and you'll see why.
The first two phases are full
of these painstakingly
drawn special attacks
from a very, very big game sprite.
Then things become unbelievable
when you break Saltbaker's
glass exterior here.
After shattering this salt shaker,
the boss appears as like
an infinite field of salt
and you'll need to avoid these attacks
and entire screens of swirling,
beautiful animation just to survive.
Don't get distracted.
We're making this boss look too easy.
Only because it took like
dozens and dozens of tries
to get this footage and
learn all the tricks.
Saltbaker really is the
magnum opus of Cuphead.
If you love bosses, you
need to experience this.
Next over at number , one
of my personal favorites, man,
Psycho Mantis.
He's the gold standard for
"Metal Gear Solid" bosses
and really bosses in general.
This is just a boss
that made us all sit up
and see the potential,
the possibility of bosses in video games.
I mean, Psycho Mantis
breaks all the rules.
He isn't the hardest boss on our list,
but he's absolutely one worth
experiencing without spoilers.
But unfortunately,
we're gonna have to spoil
everything about him.
And honestly, the entire gaming world,
if you've ever gone
online or read a magazine,
has spoiled the hell out of this.
So let's go.
Psycho Mantis has these
psychic powers, right?
He starts the battle off immediately
by possessing your partner, Meryl,
forcing you to non-lethally knock her out
before she kills herself or you.
- You are powerful indeed,
but I know your weak point.
Meryl, stand right where he can see you
and blow your brains out.
- Ah.
- Stop, Meryl.
- [Falcon] And then that's when
all the weird tricks begin.
So Psycho Mantis knows
what you're gonna do
before you do it.
He will dodge gunshots and
grenades automatically.
He'll also glitch out your game,
losing signal and kind of
showing a fake black screen
like your cable was disconnected.
The fourth wall breaking
moments of this boss fight
are really the things that
are burned into our mind now.
So Psycho Mantis will know
that you like "Castlevania"
and he'll say it because of
the "Symphony of the Night"
save file on your PS memory card.
He can even use his psychic powers
to activate the rumble on your controller.
All these interactions
seem like silly gimmicks,
but they were really creative at the time.
So to defeat Psycho Mantis's
mind reading abilities,
you'll have to clear your mind.
Basically, you need to
switch controller ports.
Because video game systems
don't have physical
controller ports anymore,
the latest release of "Metal Gear Solid "
makes you open the controller settings
and switch your controller to player two.
Either way though, like just
switching your controller
from the player one to player two
totally trips up Psycho
Mantis and he's like,
"Oh no, I can't read your mind anymore."
And then you kill him.
It's awesome.
Next up, we're at number .
The "Resident Evil "
remake did the impossible.
It took one of the best games ever
and actually improved it.
Already one of our
favorite boss fights ever,
the Krauser boss in
"Resident Evil " remake
is even cooler, putting
you in full control now.
Replacing what was mostly
like a cut scene QTE encounter
with the knife wielding Krauser
and letting you actually
perform every swing
and parry and all that stuff
is really a stroke of genius here.
And you'll only understand it
if you've played the
original, like religiously
and then jumping into the new one.
It's nice.
The first fight isn't actually what
we're talking about here.
When Krauser takes off his
shirt and slathers himself
in war paint near the end of the game,
you know it's truly on.
- This is it, soldier.
(guns firing)
(dramatic music)
- Losing your cool, making mistakes.
- I'm not falling for your mind games.
(guns firing)
- Pitiful!
- You sure you don't need a breather?
That arm of yours must be killing you.
- [Falcon] In the ruins of the base
of the evil Los Illuminados cult,
Krauser ambushes the player
and fights in a way we
haven't seen before.
Krauser isn't a monster.
He's a human with military
training and enhanced abilities.
He whips out a submachine gun early,
forcing you to take cover
as he bombards the area
and bullets and then tosses grenades.
He'll sprint towards you
for the kill with a knife,
performing deadly combo attacks
you'll need to perfectly
parry to get a hit in.
After navigating a series of traps,
including multiple weird bomb drones
that only appear in this
one section of the game,
you then have to fight
Krauser on the ruined roof
with a very tight time limit.
And that's when all your skills
are really put to the test.
Guns are more useless in
this part of the fight.
He injects himself with
one of the many viruses
that are floating around
the Resident Evil universe.
I don't know, he gets a
big pair of monster arms
and makes him pretty much
immune to a lot of bullets.
Now, in the original game,
the knife was an overpowered tool
you could use to easily
defeat Krauser's final form.
In the remake, it's really the only weapon
that's the most effective.
You gotta be good with timings,
you gotta pay attention,
but you gotta master the
whole fight to really win
and truly beat Krauser's ass.
Like I said, the original
version is incredible,
the way it was paced, all
the different areas to it,
but they really blew that
all out of the water here
with the remake.
Next, over number , the
secret boss in "Katana Zero"
is one you won't see on a lot of lists,
but it's one of our favorites.
We've definitely mentioned it before.
This is a high-speed action platformer
where your psychic samurai can
technically see the future.
Putting him in impossible situations,
you'll need to overcome
through trial and error.
It's kind of like a D
side-scrolling "Hotline Miami."
It's awesome.
And the psychiatrist
boss is the ultimate test
of your skills and isn't
even required to fight.
You'll only see him if you
piss off your handler so much,
he then suddenly injects himself
with this super psychoactive drugs
that then change your
perception completely.
So in the first phase,
the psychiatrist unleashes a
wave of these bizarre attacks.
He summons giant hands to
grab you, he copies himself,
he throws energy balls that
you need to bounce back.
It's all like an appetizer
for the real craziness.
After fighting through multiple waves,
his flesh expands into like
an ocean of meat and teeth.
It's gross.
The whole world changes around you
into a nightmare world
filled with syringes
and bubbling goo.
You'll need to survive
gauntlets of attacks
to land even a single
hit on this crazy guy.
And the blaring music
really puts you in the mood
to fight things that shouldn't exist.
It's a lot.
This is one of the strangest
and most exhilarating bosses we've fought.
And thanks to some generous checkpoints,
he's not always as difficult as he looks.
Now, next over at number ,
Hyperion is anything but
generous in "Returnal."
You know, of course, if you
haven't played "Returnal,"
it is one of the most visually
stunning roguelikes ever.
This bizarre creature plays an alien organ
and throws bullet hell levels
of projectiles at the player,
launching tracking energy
balls and shockwaves
that you'll need to dodge
all while, you know,
listening to a pretty awesome boss theme
that's tailored completely to the tempo
of the fight itself.
It's awesome.
(upbeat music)
(grunting)
The atmosphere of this boss fight
is just as memorable as the gameplay,
with the weirdo monster
returning to its organ
to launch even more
attacks from the pipes,
covering the screen in this,
like, kaleidoscope of color.
You'll feel amazing and cool
dodging all these attacks,
making this one of the
best-feeling bosses in the game,
even if it isn't the hardest.
Still, this is a roguelike.
If you lose the Hyperion,
you're starting all the
way back at the beginning.
"Returnal," at launch,
required epic length runs
to progress with not a lot
of save systems in sight,
so you better believe
our palms were sweating
during this one.
Now we're at number , "Mr. Freeze,"
from "Batman: Arkham City."
We've talked about this one a lot.
A lot of you guys probably know about it,
but we had to mention
it because if we didn't,
you would all be mad.
But it really is an incredible boss fight.
What makes Mr. Freeze so special here?
He adapts.
So if you attack from the vents,
he'll destroy every vent you see.
(guns firing)
(Batman grunts)
If you strike down from the gargoyles,
he'll destroy all them with his ice gun.
Freeze learns your
tricks 'cause he's smart,
so you need to adapt accordingly.
You need to use all of your Batman tricks.
There are so many different takedown
methods in "Arkham City,"
it is pretty easy to forget lots of them
and panic in the moment.
- Hide if you wish, Batman.
I'll find you and...
Go.
(electricity crackling)
- [Falcon] If you've been
sneaking up behind goons
and ignoring all the other creative ways
to get the jump on 'em,
this fight can be tricky.
But if you're a stealth master,
you'll put down Mr. Freeze in no time.
(explosion booms)
(dramatic music)
But still, what makes it
so special and memorable for people
is how it changes the
paradigm of a boss fight.
Not every boss fight has to
be like an all-out fist fight.
This is a back-and-forth
kind of problem-solving thing
that makes you feel like Batman
because you're thinking
about your tool set,
and every single way you
can try and take 'em down.
- I see you.
What?
No!
(dramatic music)
- [Falcon] Now, over at number
, obviously, FromSoftware,
the people behind "Dark
Souls" and "Elden Ring"
are like the undisputed
masters of boss fights.
We could do a list of the
best boss fights of all time
and fill it with their games only.
I think we've done that before, actually.
But today, we're gonna
try and limit ourselves
to the best of the best,
and it doesn't even
have to be the hardest,
even if Ludwig the Holy Blade
is a very difficult boss.
So the first boss of the
"Bloodborne" DLC here
is a twisted mutant man
with, like, a horse face
that screams and stumbles
around like this sick animal.
(screaming)
(dramatic music)
The barely coherent creature
changes halfway through the fight,
and the music changes, too.
Now, in his second phase,
Ludwig the Accursed transforms completely.
He then wields the infamous
Moonlight Greatsword,
you know, the recurring
FromSoftware weapon,
and he's pretty awesome with it.
He stands up tall like a person
and speaks with his original voice,
regaining, I guess, a
splinter of his humanity
for a brief moment.
The music changes from discordant noise
to a melodic, incredible
orchestrated piece.
(dramatic orchestral music)
We don't know a lot about this guy,
but his boss fight gives us, you know,
the full breadth of his experience.
Now a twisted shadow of his former self,
he finds himself again while fighting you
and takes an epic boss fight
and makes it even better.
This is one of our favorite bosses
from the entire "Souls" series,
but it isn't the last
FromSoftware boss on our list.
Next, over at number ,
one of the most surprising boss fights
in video game history
comes from one of the most
seemingly unassuming games.
We've talked about "Undertale"
more than anyone should,
but we'll never forget
the Flowey boss fight
for how it completely changed our
perception of a boss fight.
And just look at this thing.
Flowey looks nothing like
anything else in the game.
The cute, simplistic
pixel art of "Undertale,"
the style here, is really replaced
by this deranged mess of photo
manipulation and grotesque art.
And there's a good reason for that.
An artist, Everdred, was
hired to give this boss
its unreal Photoshop look,
and it sticks with you.
Flowey is the final boss
of a standard peaceful run of "Undertale."
It's also so overwhelming,
the fight seems totally impossible to win.
(dramatic music)
This boss is like an
all-powerful godlike entity,
so no matter what you do,
you'll only be able to win
by the skin of your teeth,
and that's by design.
This is a boss that's
designed to feel difficult
without actually being difficult.
Technically, you can lose
the fight against Flowey,
but the game plays tricks on you.
The closer you are to death,
the less damage Flowey will do,
essentially giving you many,
many more chances at life
when it seems like you're desperate
and you're about to bite the big one.
Flowey's an impressive
technical achievement,
an awesome, iconic visual,
and just a plain fun boss
that turns the screws and scares you
while keeping training
wheels on at the same time.
It's clever.
It's a style of boss design
we've seen in more games
since "Undertale" first debuted,
and it's a brilliant bit
of developer trickery
that's worth copying for any
cinematic boss battle, really.
(dramatic music)
Now, next over at number
, "Metal Gear Rising"
is like the pinnacle achievement
when it comes to cool boss fights.
The pumping music, the
blazing fast action here
makes every boss a weird,
special, awesome encounter.
We had a hard time choosing just one,
but today we've settled on
Raiden's rival, Jetstream Sam.
Set in its own unique chapter here,
Jetstream Sam is the swordsman
that defeats Raiden at
the start of the game,
and much later in the game,
you get a chance to kick his ass,
or get vengeance, or, I
mean, revengeance, you know.
So Jetstream Sam unleashes
like this lightning-fast blade attacks.
He'll sheathe his sword and
pull the trigger on the hilt,
swinging his sword with
the speed of a bullet, man.
He has like a wide range of attacks,
and he's very difficult to parry,
which is what you've been doing
to fight enemies for the entire game.
(dramatic music)
(grunting)
- Show me a good time, Jack.
- [Falcon] By perfectly
parrying his sword strikes,
you'll be able to knock Sam's
weapon out of his hands,
and the cool guy will just keep fighting
with his bare hands then.
Jetstream Sam is just a cinematic fight
that's worth celebrating in a game
that's full of best boss
fight material, really.
- Hot.
(grunting)
(laughs)
Now this is a fight.
- [Falcon] Next over
at number , Raphael.
The devil on your shoulder here
is an optional boss in "Baldur's Gate ,"
and one of the best
boss fights in the game.
- One of the best bosses
we fought in any CRPG.
This pompous little hell spawn taunts you
from the beginning of the game to the end,
offering you an easy solution
to your pesky brain worm problem.
He's offering salvation,
and we should know
better than to, you know,
sign a deal with a demon.
After fighting him,
we're seriously considering
just giving up our souls.
It would be a lot easier
than fighting a monster
with  health.
The fourth wall-breaking boss here
even has his own unique song.
He belts out his lyrics
with dripping disdain
for the silly mortals that
are trying to defeat him here.
♪ Hell, hell, where I was born. ♪
♪ Hell, hell, infecting the cause ♪
♪ Cutting floors, but hold your applause ♪
♪ Squirm, squirm, for now
down here come the claw. ♪
- [Falcon] He sings his own boss theme
like he's in a musical,
which is actually a perfect fit
for a villain that might just be a bard.
If you look carefully,
you can see that he's wearing
a set of boots of brilliance,
which restore bardic inspiration,
and his song is very intimidating
when you're struggling to
keep your head above water
against a horde of some of the
toughest enemies from hell,
all attacking you at once.
He's throwing it all at you.
This is an epic fight that's fitting
as one of our absolute
favorite villains from any RPG.
♪ No more deals ♪
♪ It's over ♪
♪ The final act ♪
♪ You're doomed ♪
♪ No more grace ♪
♪ It's over ♪
♪ This house of hope. ♪
♪ You're doomed. ♪
(dramatic music)
- [Falcon] Now, next over at number nine,
the "Yakuza" series is another
boss fight staple here.
There are almost endless
cinematic bosses to choose from,
and the most recent, "Infinite Wealth,"
is packed with the most
ridiculous fights yet.
You'll battle immortal
old men with machine guns
and wizard squids on a nuclear island,
but that isn't silly enough for this.
If you're looking for the
goofiest fight in the series,
we're taking on the Robo Michio Rangers.
Found at the bottom of the
Hawaii Haunt optional dungeon,
these are a squad of Power Rangers
that have gone haywire and want you dead.
It isn't enough that
you have to fight one.
You'll need to fight
five at the same time,
and it's even better if you
understand the backstory.
So Ono is the ugly mascot
that first appeared
in "Yakuza ," and he
just keeps coming back.
Infinite Wealth takes his
reappearance to the extreme.
Someone has made an
evil robotic Ono Michio,
and they made a bunch more.
This is one of the
toughest fights in the game
and one of the most fun if you're looking
to overcome every challenge in the game,
and there are a lot.
And we always love a good
"Power Rangers" ripoff, boss.
We can make a list on that subject alone.
- Let's end this!
(upbeat rock music)
Full power!
(cacophony of voices overlapping)
(robots grunting)
- All right,
I'll see ya, I guess.
- [Falcon] Now over at number eight,
another personal favorite of mine.
If there's one "Metal Gear Solid" boss
you need to fight before you die,
it's The End from "Metal Gear Solid ."
In the tradition of amazing
"Metal Gear" bosses,
The End might be the pinnacle
purely for the mechanics of this boss.
This fight can technically last for hours.
It's set in a huge map
covering multiple locations,
and The End here is a
stealthy sniper in camouflage
that'll headshot you if you
stick your head out of it
or if you're not careful.
So stealth is key here as you slowly inch
through these jungle maps
and search for your target.
(gun firing)
(Snake grunts)
- [The End] What's the matter?
I'm over here!
- [Falcon] You'll need every
gadget to detect The End.
He's stationary,
so the motion detector
won't usually help you.
This fight changes every
time you attempt it.
You can move carefully,
watching for the glint of a sniper scope
to find The End's location,
or you can listen with the sonic device
to hear his breathing.
If shooting him is too slow,
try leaving behind poisonous food,
or you can simply wait
a week of in-game time
and let him die of old age.
Yes, you can really do that.
You can also kill him earlier in the game
if you're very careful and very fast,
but that's a whole other video.
(gun firing)
- Come in, HQ.
(gun firing)
The enemy is attacking
from an unknown position.
(Snake grunts)
Beginning alert status.
- [Falcon] Next over at number seven,
"Shadow of the Colossus"
had to go on this list somewhere, man.
And we had to pick one of the most
exhilarating encounters in the game.
The fight against Phalanx
takes you off the ground
and into the skies as you
hold on for dear life.
You're in this vast desert,
and the Phalanx is the
largest Colossus in the game.
And it's actually one of the most passive.
It doesn't even really attack you.
It's just kind of swirling
dragon-like through the sky.
(dramatic music)
By shooting the big bladders with arrows,
this thing will lower itself enough
that you can then jump off your horse
and grab onto one of the wings
and get whisked away into this fight.
From this point, you're
stuck up in the sky with him.
Yeah, gotta be careful.
He twists around through the
air at really intense speeds,
and it is just, it's a
spectacle of a battle.
While the PS original is
an incredible achievement,
the PS remake is worth experiencing
for boss fights like this for sure.
(dramatic music)
Next over, number six,
one of the most epic
boss fights of all time.
It feels strange even
including Safer Sephiroth
from "Final Fantasy VII" on this list.
Compared to boss fights from today,
he doesn't look that impressive.
He's a low-poly PS character model
in a world where we have
photorealistic graphics now,
but we can't overstate the impact
of Safer Sephiroth in "Final Fantasy VII."
The one-winged angel boss music
and the incredibly
over-the-top magic spell
that feels like a precursor
to the amazing boss fights
from "Final Fantasy XVI,"
there's so much going on here.
For a long time in our childhood,
Safer Sephiroth was the boss
fight to end all boss fights,
and the top tier of
every epic moment list.
This boss has a summon
attack called Supernova
that lasts over two minutes
just to show a comet
destroying the entire galaxy.
Of course it can't be skipped,
and we wouldn't want to.
Safer Sephiroth is the
peak of the mountain
Square Enix has to climb
in "Final Fantasy VII
Remake" chapter three.
Whatever they do for this,
I'm already getting chills.
It's gotta be amazing.
It's gonna be very over-the-top.
We can't wait to see what they do
for remaking one of the most iconic
JRPG bosses of all time.
(dramatic music)
(explosions booming)
(explosion booming)
Now at number five,
we're taking a big turn
before the end of the video
because we had to include the final boss
of "Asura's Wrath" somewhere.
If you've never heard of
this game, you're welcome.
It's one of the weirdest
games in Capcom's library.
It's kind of like a series of cut scenes
and combat scenarios and boss
fights designed as a game.
It also sold the ending as DLC, sorta,
so if you didn't pay the ending tax,
you might've never seen arguably
one of the wildest bosses we've seen.
This final fight against the creator,
a being known as Chakravartin,
starts with you dodging entire planets,
and then it only gets crazier from there.
(grunting)
So in his final form, he
plays with your perception
and tries to trick you
by subverting the mechanics of the game.
He does something we've never
seen in any other video game.
He actually takes control over your QTEs,
or quick time events.
In the second phase of his final form,
the creator will periodically
replace your QTE inputs
with his symbol.
If you follow the onscreen instructions,
you'll be helping him
instead of your character.
This guy is godlike, so, I mean,
why wouldn't he be able
to change things like that
in the game?
It's just clever, weird, and fun,
like "Asura's Wrath" in general.
(grunting)
- The suffering this world has seen.
(grunting)
Was all to choose my heir!
- [Falcon] Now down to number four,
"Super Metroid" introduced an
entire generation of players
to the cinematic boss fight,
a fight that felt impossible,
a fight that made us feel
overwhelmed in every way,
but is actually designed to be beaten.
And the fight against Mother Brain
is one of the most iconic boss fights
in video game history, man.
After hours of exploring
this like creepy abandoned alien planet,
Samus fights the evil
Mother Brain in her lair.
The initial nostalgic fight
designed to mirror her original battle
from the old school one on NES
actually quickly becomes
something very different
as the Mother Brain mutates
into a walking rampaging monster.
(laser charging)
(dramatic music)
After a long fight,
the Mother Brain charges a beam
that then drains Samus's health
and leaves the player like desperately
on the brink of death.
And as the boss charges one final blast,
the little Metroid you've met earlier
jumps in and drains
Mother Brain's essence,
giving it to Samus and charging you up
with an incredibly powerful beam.
It's a dramatic cinematic moment
in a game that's almost completely free
of scripted story sequences.
It just took us by surprise
and really stuck with us,
making this one of those boss fights
you just gotta experience.
(Mother Brain screaming)
Now down at number three,
"Ocarina of Time" is another video game
that just like hits differently.
This game itself was a huge step forward
for the "Legend of Zelda" series,
making the D games feel more tactile
and viable in general.
They didn't have to be
slow and methodical.
You could have like a
thrilling sword fight
and an adventure in D.
That was a big deal back in the day
when this game originally released.
And the biggest moment of it all,
the showstopper, really the future,
was the fight against Ganondorf.
At the end of the game,
in the ruins of the castle,
you'll battle the fully
transformed Ganondorf.
Instead of like the silly pig guy
he was in previous games or whatever,
he is a massive dark figure
in the burning ruins here.
His glowing eyes and giant double axes
just really scared the
hell out of us as kids.
(dramatic music)
(lightning cracking)
(Zelda gasps)
- Hey!
(dramatic music)
- [Falcon] This wasn't like a
little kid version of Ganon.
This is the scary Ganon.
And the fight itself blew our minds.
You have to remember that
the sword fighting system
in "Ocarina of Time" was groundbreaking.
In the same way "Mario
" made D platforming
feel really fun and you
could see the future of it,
"Ocarina of Time" proved
sword fighting and combat
and action could be done
in three dimensions.
And "Ganon" was the ultimate
test of those skills.
It's really fun to go
back and just like think
about how much has
changed since this fight,
but it's still one of those fights
you need to experience before you die.

Now coming down at number two, of course,
Malenia is the end boss
of video game bosses.
The Blade of Miquella might
be over hyped at this point.
So let's all just say this,
is "Malenia" the hardest video game boss?
No, but there are harder
bosses in "Elden Ring"
due to the "Shadow of
Erdtree" DLC and stuff.
But without a doubt,
FromSoftware is going to hurt us
with even crueler bosses in the future,
but very few bosses feel as overwhelming
and as impossible as this one.
(dramatic orchestral music)
There are so many epic
FromSoftware bosses,
Isshin, the Sword Saint, the Orphan of Kos
are two easy contenders
for the most difficult,
but neither of them poison you
with the deadliest poison in the game
or hit you with combos
that are seemingly impossible to dodge.
Malenia is thankfully a
totally optional boss,
but she's so challenging,
there are players that are now
famous just for fighting her.
Beating this boss is like
a new rite of passage
in video games, a test to see
if you've got what it takes.
And we don't blame anyone
here for giving up.
Sometimes it just isn't worth it,
but it's incredibly awesome
and a hell of a good time,
or at least a hell of a
good time if you're a sicko.
(dramatic orchestral music)
Now, down at number one, "Sifu."
It's a Kung Fu action
roguelike game of our dreams
with infinite combat depth.
As you learn the ins and
outs of perfect parrying,
dodging, blocking, and everything else
that makes this action
game so difficult and fun
in like the best ways.
Mastering a boss and learning
to counter their every move
to deal critical core damage
and beat them without
killing them is a big deal.
It makes us feel great,
but there's one boss
we might never master.
Yang, the leader, is
the final boss of "Sifu"
and one of the most
difficult bosses in games.
He's the last challenge
in your roguelike run,
and he'll test your
skill in a way, you know,
we don't really see in video games.
He's better at Kung Fu than you,
so tricks like using your
focus attacks just won't work.
(grunting)
Look, to be honest, when
we couldn't win a fight,
we'd use our trusty leg sweep attack.
That would often work,
but Yang dodges it instantly here.
He dodges everything you do,
and if you attack while he
blocks, he'll auto-counter.
The only way to hit back is to spam dodge,
hope he doesn't attack low,
and counter for the brief
moment he leaves himself open.
Even at the highest level,
this fight can go either
way for top-tier players.
He's like the modern Mike
Tyson from "Punch-Out,"
a boss that's so difficult,
most people are probably
never gonna beat him.
I'm not totally sure how
some of us beat him here,
but it was a wild ride,
and everyone needs to try it,
or at least experience it
in some way at least once.
All of these are video game magic.
It's  boss fights we think
you need to experience,
and there are so, so many more
that we couldn't fit on this list,
so if you have a favorite boss fight,
let us know in the comments.
We would love to talk
