(video game effects)
- Hey folks.     
Today is Friday, January th, .
As usual, my name is Jake Baldino
here to talk about all the video game news
that has been going on this week.
We should just start
off with the big thing.
We didn't cover it yesterday
when it was officially revealed.
We saved it for today.
The Switch Two has been
announced by Nintendo.
Probably the worst kept secret.
This thing leaked like crazy.
But now we finally have
a brief announcement video from Nintendo.
Just a two-minute little teaser trailer,
really just highlighting the
hardware and that's about it.
So what are the biggest changes?
At least from what we know right now,
we don't know any specs.
You can still go on the leaks
and expect a significant boost in power,
but the reality is it's
all on the outside here
what we're talking today.
So one of the biggest changes
is the redesign of the
Joy-Cons officially.
It looks like the joysticks
might be upgraded.
Hopefully there's no stick drift,
and the way these things attach
to the Nintendo Switch is changed.
No longer do they slide in.
Now they sturdily snap in, presumably
with some sort of magnetic thing.
There's also these little connectors
in the embedded grooves.
Those look very breakable.
We're gonna have to see how
that goes, but they are thicker.
The device itself is larger
than a regular Nintendo Switch.
The kickstand is redesigned
and it seems like it's
got a lot of movability,
just like the leaks suggested.
Also, there's a second
USB port, which is nice.
There's potential there for a lot
of fun stuff with accessories.
Really, the added
flexibility absolutely works.
There's also, it seems like there's going
to be release buttons for the Joy-Cons
that are a little bit bigger
on the back of the Joy-Cons
different than the originals,
as well as a button
that we still don't know
on the right Joy-Con
what exactly that button does.
I'm curious to see if like that's one
of Nintendo's little ACEs up their sleeve.
Some sort of gimmick or trick
that hasn't been revealed.
But also the Joy-Cons
themselves, going back to them.
It seems like they do have some
sort of mouse functionality.
The video highlighted them kind
of like surface down on a flat surface
and moving around like a mouse
with a little additional
accessory that it connects into
to make it flat along the surface.
Weird, interesting.
I'd seen that rumored before, I believe,
and I don't know what
this could amount to.
Is this just a little Nintendo gimmick
or is this an absolute game changer?
You know, we're still gonna
have to really wait and see.
Nintendo has also officially announced
that the Nintendo Switch Two
will play Nintendo Switch
Two exclusive games
as well as Nintendo Switch
games, both physical and digital.
They did note that with an asterisk
that some games won't be compatible.
I wonder what exactly that means.
Is it going to be just a select few
because of a little controller things,
or is it gonna be a
significant amount of games?
We'll have to wait and see.
But in terms of games,
the only actual information
we got is a brief, vague look
at a new Mario Kart game.
People have kind of zoomed in and looked
and looked at the character designs.
Things are different.
It's not just Mario Kart
eight re-released again
for the nth time.
This is a seemingly new,
full fledged Mario Kart game
with some eagle-eyed observers noticing
that the track has the
most racers on a track
that the franchise has ever featured.
That's really it.
That's all we have to go on.
It looks like more Mario Kart to me.
The trailer uploaded
to YouTube is in P,
so maybe that's something,
maybe that's not, who knows.
But for now, that's all we have.
We finally know after all the leaks,
they just said, okay it exists.
Nintendo Switch Two is a real thing.
We know that it is officially releasing
at some point in ,
and we're going to be getting
more news about it April nd.
We gotta wait a while.
That actually sucks.
I was hoping to hear a
little bit more before then.
But April nd is when there's going
to be a Nintendo Direct
where more is revealed
and then there's going to be kind
of like a fan experience
event from April through May,
depending on where you are
in North America or Europe,
where fans will be able to
get hands on with this thing.
If that's the thing,
and that's like the promotional tour,
where that wraps up in May.
I would, guess that we
see this thing towards
the end of the year,
like a holiday season
release type of thing.
But that's really all we have to go on.
Like I said, it was a very simple,
very straightforward
announcement from Nintendo.
I really wanna know more
about the games man,
but I guess we're gonna
have to wait until April.
But the big thing here,
these videos are the best way
to gauge interest from
you, the Gameranx viewers.
How do you feel about the
Nintendo Switch reveal?
Let us know.
Let us know what you're thinking.
If you're a diehard Nintendo
fan, a casual Nintendo fan,
somebody who's not on the
Nintendo train at all.
We would definitely love
to know your feedback
just to see how the next months
and years kind of start to shape up.
Me personally, I'm cautiously optimistic.
I really, really love the initial reveal
and announcement of the
original Nintendo Switch.
This time I don't have
the same excitement,
but at the end of the day,
the Nintendo Switch needed
a power boost significantly,
so I'll take what I can get.
Next up, of course, like I
said, the Nintendo Switch Two
had plenty of leaks.
We also knew a couple
of days in advance when this
thing was going to be announced
by a leaker, scooper on the internet,
known as Nate The Hate.
Nate The Hate has at this point had
a pretty decent track record,
and it's worth pointing
out that on social media,
they also kind of teased a
possible PlayStation Direct
if you've been hungry for
some PlayStation news.
In a social media post
when someone asked if there
was any State of Play news,
he said, hey, how about February?
That's all we have.
A lot of people are taking that
and running with that saying,
all right, February is when
we're getting a State of Play.
I almost said PlayStation Direct again.
I get all these corporate names mixed up.
But anyway, State of
Play, maybe in February.
Maybe not.
Like I said, he nailed
the Nintendo Switch thing,
but who knows.
Again, it's just insider stuff.
We're gonna have to wait
and see, but if there is
a PlayStation Direct, I
would very much like that
because I'd like to see what's going on
with that Wolverine game.
It's been quite a while
since we've heard anything.
Also, it feels like we're due
for a Resident Evil announcement,
a Resident Evil nine thing finally.
That's just like I feel it in my bones,
I feel it in the air.
Next up, there were some
more Elder Scrolls Oblivion
remake leaks essentially from
an employee from Severios.
MPst is reporting that
the development studio
who has ported and remade
things in the past is working on
this and now new details include
some overhauled mechanics.
Apparently the game is going to be running
an Unreal Engine Five and combat
and essentially combat
feel and how blocking works
and how archery works is
going to be overhauled.
How the stamina system works
is going to be tweaked.
The menus and interface are also going
to be made a little bit more modern
because the old ones were a
little ugly and cluttered.
And the report does suggest
that we might see the game,
somewhere in the middle of .
For me, the most interesting thing,
and I did cover this on my
channel, youtube.com/jakebaldino.
I dove a little deeper into this.
For me, the most interesting
thing is Unreal Engine Five.
I think there are some
great things about that
and also maybe some
technical issues with that.
But compared to the
state of Bethesda games
in their normal engine,
I think it'll be interesting
to see this difference.
But also I'm curious to see
where the Skyblivion project will end up.
We've talked about this for years now.
The fan project
of people remaking Oblivion
in Skyrim's engine and stuff.
I hope that still is a thing,
but either way, I just
really like Oblivion,
so more Oblivion, the better.
I just hope that if they
do do this like remake,
this official remake re-release,
they include the horse armor again
because that's when everything changed.
That's when gaming
history changed forever.
Next up, this video is
sponsored by Incogni.
Here's the deal.
There are thousands of brokers
and aggregators out there
harvesting, storing,
and trading around your personal data
without you even knowing about it.
Yes, there are data brokers
out there holding onto loads
of things of yours, like
your full name, your gender,
your age, your address, your
phone number, you name it.
You've probably heard a
headline all the time.
A major company getting
their website hacked.
It's happened to me personally.
I know there's plenty of
websites I've signed up for
a random account for,
totally forgot about it.
Only for that website to be hacked.
All those accounts is stolen.
Suddenly my email inbox
is full, which tells me
that my email is just publicly out there
being shared around by these data brokers.
I don't want that, you don't want that,
and that's where Incogni helps out.
You actually have a right
to go out to these companies
and request your data be removed,
but the problem is there's
so many of those companies,
that's where Incogni helps.
All you do is create an account
and say, whose personal data you want
to be requested to be removed.
Then after those two easy steps,
you just sit back and
watch Incogni get to work.
It's at an intuitive,
easy-to-read dashboard that's,
it's really cool and it
shows you the progress
of all these things happening.
It's really fun to just
set it up, sit back
and watch this progress
happen right in front of you.
So if you wanna check it out,
you can actually get % off
an annual Incogni plan.
You just gotta go to incogni.com/gameranx
and use code Gameranx when you're there.

Again, that's incogni.com/gameranx
and use code Gameranx for % off Incogni.
And with that, big thanks to Incogni
for sponsoring this video.
Now let's get back to the news.
But of course, if you're
already sick of remakes
and re-release and remasters,
I got one more for you.
Of course, the Assassin's Creed
Black Flag re-release remake
thing has been known for a
while now, heavily leaked
and rumored and suggested
and I think pretty much acknowledged
by Ubisoft themselves at some point.
But now a new leak again from
the website reporting MPst,
suggests that the game is actually going
to not just be like a visual overhaul,
but some gameplay overhauls as well.
According to the report, thanks
to like a job leak listing,
a project description.
New systems with combat
and ecosystems around wildlife
specifically mentioned.
That's really it other
than the report reiterating
that we might see this in fall .
That being said, I didn't expect them
to really significantly overhaul systems,
but I say that as a biased person
who really loves Assassin's
Creed Black Flag.
It's one of my favorite games ever.
Still, it's interesting
if they do invest the time
and resources to make
this a substantial remake
or re-release because they could have done
that from the beginning
instead of investing millions
and billions into Skull and Bones.
But hey, what do I know?
I'm just an armchair guy.
Next up, unfortunately, some bad news is
to something I talked about
like a week or so ago.
The Grand Theft Auto
Five Liberty City mod,
the Liberty City Preservation project.
Unfortunately that has been shut down.
So a group of fans, community
modders, developers,
put together a great map
of GTA Four's Liberty City
to be added to Grant Theft Auto Five,
but it seems like Rockstar
Games gave it the ax.
The statement in the
project for the Discord is,
hey everyone, "Due to
the unexpected attention
that our project received and
after speaking with Rockstar
Games, we have decided
to take down the Liberty
City Preservation project.
We appreciate all the support
that the project has received
and we look forward to
continuing to pursue our passion
for modding the Grand Theft Auto series."
That is an absolute bummer
because it seems like
they did incredible work,
not only just with building
and recreating GTA Four's Liberty City,
but also just like how
they put it out there
and the trailers and everything like
the reveal that we talked about.
They just did a great job.
So I'd say somebody
just hire these people.
Of course Rockstar is
gonna shut down things
for legal reasons, it's
their property, whatever.
But at the very least, these
people are incredibly talented
and deserve their flowers.
Just like all the modders and
creative people out there.
I always say it, man when
people are fans of games
and they have some
knowledge and some skill,
the sky is the limit.
Next up in some announcements and stuff,
we have a trailer for
the Until Dawn movie.
This is from David Sandberg,
the guy who directed the Shazam movies,
one of the Annabelle movies,
a couple of other horror
things and yeah, here you go.
I don't know.
It's an Until Dawn movie.
I like that they're
playing with the formula
and the concept here is like
they die and they repeat
and like different things happen to them.
So it's messing with the formula,
it's going for a video gamey thing,
but I don't know, to me it just
doesn't really scream much.
And with Until Dawn
itself being so inspired
by horror movies, it's
still managed to feel cool
and unique and iconic.
Whereas here, now you
have a movie based on
a video game series that was
celebrating horror movies.
It just kind of feels like, meh, whatever.
That being said, I will not
judge a book by its cover.
I will give it an honest shot,
but for now, yeah, if you wanna see
that trailer, here you go.
That's my opinion.
Also, we got a cool trailer.
Thank you guys so much
for sending this to me.
A lot of people were like, this
is a Jake Baldino ass game.
And thank you. I agree.
This is The Blood of Dawnwalker.
This was teased a week or so back,
but now we got a full
reveal cinematic trailer.
This is significant because
it's from the director
of the Witcher three.
They left CD Projekt RED to
do their own thing and yeah.
Unfortunately this is a
mostly cinematic trailer
with little snippets of what
might be gameplay at the end,
but still just setting the
mood, the tone, the atmosphere,
I love this.
It's like a Witcher three style thing,
but with more vampires,
where vampires have a lot of control.
All different types of vampires.
We've seen a lot of different archetypes
and powers on display here.
As a vampire nerd, I
really like seeing this
and yeah, I hope this is good.
We're going to get actual looks
at gameplay in the summer,
which is painful.
But for now, I'm gonna be honest,
even with the cinematic trailer
and just like the people behind it,
it's shot to like pretty high
on my most anticipated list.
Next, in terms of releases this week
we have Donkey Kong Country
Returns HD on Nintendo Switch,
a revival, a remaster of a classic.
Also Assetto Corsa EVO.
As of right now, the launch
is a little bit rough.
There's some stuff it's missing.
The Steam reviews have
not been super kind,
but yeah, it's there.
Also Dynasty Warriors Origins.
I think we're gonna be
trying to squeeze in a quick
before you buy some first
impressions on this at some point,
because it seems like the upward swing
for the Dynasty Warriors games.
The reviews so far have been pretty good.
Last but not least, and I have
talked about this elsewhere,
like on my podcast Friends
per Second and stuff.
But I do want to give you
guys a quick little tease,
a snippet of Kingdom Come Deliverance Two.
I've been playing it for
review for quite some time,
and I can talk about the
first  hours or so.
And all I can say,
I don't wanna like totally
spoil my review or anything,
but I will say if you are a fan
of Kingdom Come Deliverance,
then the sequel seems uncompromised.
It seems very much like more
but higher quality, incredible music,
better production values,
even better voice acting
performances, visuals.
But also down to gameplay stuff
that really matters, right.
World design, the size of the world,
the density of the world, the
compelling content within it,
the amount of side quests
I already found myself getting lost on,
and also screwing up so
many of those side quests
and seeing how the game
adapts and continues to go,
and how NPCs react and how things change.
So far, it seems like the original.
A very old school, not handholdy, RPG,
that constantly tries to
throw challenges in your face
and make things kind of frustrating.
It's got a little bit
of a weird save system,
but it seems like an
old school love letter
and so far I've been having a lot of fun.
Again, I need my full review
to really talk about some technical stuff
and how those gameplay
systems actually pan out
over , , , , , whatever hours.
But first impressions at the very least
for within the first 
hours or so of the game.
I can only report good news so far.
Things are looking all right.
But stay tuned for our full
"Before You Buy" video
that I'll be posting closer
to the games release.
But for now, I figured I'd
leave you guys with that today.
That's it.
So let me know what you guys
think about all the stories.
Of course, Kingdom Come Deliverance Two.
I'd love to know what you
think about my hot takes,
but the Nintendo Switch reveal,
that's the biggest thing.
I want to know how you
guys feel about that.
From the name of it, you
think that's creative or not,
to the Mario Kart glimpses, anything.
Let me know what you think.
Of course, let's talk about
all the leaks, the rumors,
what you want from a
PlayStation State of Play.
Anything at all down in those comments.
We'll be down there as much as possible.
But of course if you want
to yell at me directly,
I'm on Twitter, Instagram,
Bluesky, YouTube,
all those places @Jakebaldino.
Just look up my name here.
But thank you guys very much.
I am here every Friday getting you
just quickly caught up on the news.
I never miss a week.
Thank you guys for being here forever.
Now, clicking a like button
does help us out. Thank you.
But that's it.
I'm Jake Baldino. I almost forgot my name.
Wow.
(coughing)
I'm Jake Baldino, have a
great weekend. Pizzas on me.
(coughing)
Why am I dying?
